Between Cycles: (triolet form)

One and Two:

auntie nena grows unwell each and every day
all the work rapidly piling up on me
she’s forgetting what to say
auntie nena grows unwell each and every day

all the work rapidly piling up on me
I find myself losing energy
she grows unwell each and every day
she’s forgetting what to say

Two and Three:

pieces of me frustrated
with no way to cope
nothing left that is free, elated
pieces of me isolated

with no way to cope
no sparkle to show
nothing left that is free, elated
pieces of me deflated

Three and Four:

bubbles of hope float
to the surface, ever gently
dim sparkle to show
aboard a lifeboat

to the surface, ever gently
dim sparkle to show
help nearby, readily
first steps out, steadily
