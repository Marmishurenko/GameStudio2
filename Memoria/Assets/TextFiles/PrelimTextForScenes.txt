Shower Scene


First Cycle:


with care I clean auntie nena
I tell her about my dreams
I tell her about my friends
I tell her about my life
with care I wash her
I ask “auntie, how do you feel today”
in Tagalog she grumbles “be quiet”


Second Cycle:


with care I clean auntie nena
I tell her how it was hard to wake up

in Tagalog she calls me “the help”

I tell you more each week
quick fingers
at the ready

news, news, news about joy

do you hear?
I’m here
but I hear silence

One and Two:


auntie nena grows unwell each and every day
all the work rapidly piling up on me
she’s forgetting what to say

pieces of me isolated
