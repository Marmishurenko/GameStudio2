Cycle 1
I can’t remember if I always hated grocery stores...
Funny, I can’t remember when or what I ate last time...
Is this Brian from high school over there? 
[Brian] — Mimi? Hi! It’s been a while!How…
Ok…I can just pretend I’m listening to the music and don’t hear him.
I think it worked…

Cycle 2
Brian was my friend…ages ago. I hope I don’t run into him today.
We used to build tree houses and steal beer from this store.
All of this happened in another life, a different universe it feels like.
[Bryan] — Hey! Mimi! This is Brian! Mimi? Yumi? Hey! Hey!
Why bother to remember… I don’t go by Mimi anymore.
 I can pretend I don’t see him. I don’t want to talk. I want to be alone. 

Cycle 3
I wonder if Brian is here again today.
I want to push him and tell him to go away.
I don’t want him to see me like this.
[Brian] — Yumi! I know you see me! Are you ok?
I don’t recognize you.
I don’t recognize myself. 

Cycle 4
If I run into Brian one more time...
I’m not sure.
Maybe that wouldn’t be so bad.
Maybe I could use a friend.
Maybe...
[Brian] Yumi! Where are you going? Let’s catch up, grab a beer together!
